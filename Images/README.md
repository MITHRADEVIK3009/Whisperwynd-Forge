## üìå Prototype Stage
- **Image:** `initial_ui.jpg`  
- **Description:** First attempt at UI with basic validation.  
  - UUIDs had to be entered manually.  
  - PDF rendering was unstable.  
  - Modules were not clearly separated.  

---

## üîÑ Iteration 1 ‚Äì UUID Automation
- **Image:** `uuid_fix.jpg`  
- **Description:** Introduced auto-generation of UUIDs.  
  - Eliminated errors from manual ID entry.  
  - Enabled consistent request tracking across workflows.  

---

## üñºÔ∏è Iteration 2 ‚Äì Image & PDF Modules
- **Image:** `image_pdf_module.jpg`  
- **Description:** Modularized workflows for independent testing.  
  - Image requests handled separately from PDF.  
  - Improved error reporting for PDF edge cases.  

---

## ‚ö° Iteration 3 ‚Äì Full Integration Test
- **Image:** `integration_test.jpg`  
- **Description:** Unified workflow validation.  
  - Verified that modules communicate seamlessly.  
  - Enabled cross-checking results from multiple sources.  

---

##  Final UI Design
- **Image:** `final_dashboard.png`  
- **Description:** Refined dashboard with grid-based layout and color scheme.  
  - Cleaner navigation.  
  - Cards for each workflow (metrics, validation, images, PDFs, integration).  
  - Easier debugging thanks to modular separation.

##  Summary
- Evolution shows **incremental improvements**: prototype ‚Üí validation ‚Üí modularization ‚Üí integration ‚Üí polished UI.  
- Each image is not just a screenshot but a checkpoint in design decisions.  
- This folder acts as **visual documentation** of the MCP server‚Äôs growth.

---

##  Future Scope
- Deploy server beyond local host (`127.0.0.1:9000`).  
- Add performance analytics dashboard.  
- Enable multi-user collaborative testing.
